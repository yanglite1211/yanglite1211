Below is just about everything that I've come across to develop and style my blog and website. 
Check them out!

## Prose
[https://prose.io/](https://prose.io/)
Prose is a content editor for GitHub designed for managing websites. It has a nice and simple UI and is good for starter. 

## Github Pages and Jekyll Tutorial
[WebJeda youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbOO7d0vVo0kIrkd7m32irg)
Tutorials showing you how to
	- create a GitHub Pages website (blog host)
    - add a custom domain/subdomain
    - create a Jekyll blog (blog structure and theme)
    - create a working contact form
    - edit and add new posts
    - add Disqus comments module

## Github Pages
[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)
You can create a website directly from a GitHub repository free.
Notes:
	"The default publishing source for user and organization sites is the master branch. If the repository for your user or organization site has a master branch, your site will publish automatically from that branch. You cannot choose a different publishing source for user or organization sites." 
    For example: If user [yanglite1211](https://github.com/yanglite1211) creates a respository named **yanglite1211.github.io**, this is a special GitHub Pages project called **the user site** (Lite Yang's user website). It will be automatically published at [yanglite1211.github.io](yanglite1211.github.io). In this case, the master branch is the only choice for publication, and there is no need to generate a **gh-page** branch. 
    However, if [yanglite1211](https://github.com/yanglite1211) creates a respository named **yanglite1211**, GitHub sees it just as a regular project or a regular GitHub Pages project if you plan to develop a webiste from it. It will be automatically published as a sub-domain at [yanglite1211.github.io/yanglite1211]. In this case, you are able to choose the branch to publish from, and usually <code>gh-pages</code> is recommended.
