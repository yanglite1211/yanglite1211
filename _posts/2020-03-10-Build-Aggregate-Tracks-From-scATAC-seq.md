title: Build Aggregate Tracks From scATAC-seq
subtitle: >-
  Single-cell ATAC-seq allows scientists to study the chromatin accessibility of
  a heterogenous tissue at single-cell resolution. However, the sparsity of the
  scATAC-seq data makes it to recover informative features and to assess
  variability between cells.
